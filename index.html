  <p>
    Almost two years into the pandemic and more issues are coming to light.
    The Bronx has one of the highest percentage of students who are homeless and going to school in New York City.
    Now this grave issue is proven to be true, as new studies show that homeless students attendance have dropped this school year. </p>

    <p> Multiple reports from the Department of Education have shown a drop of attendance for homeless students.
      This has contributed to student led orgainzations coming up with resolutions for homelesss students to get the education they need.

    <p>  <a href="https://www.advocatesforchildren.org/node/1675">Advocates for Children of New York,</a> non-profit organization is dedicated to helping underpriveleged students in New York get acess to high quality education.
       In a recent study by the organization, it found that attendance rates for students living in shelters were lower than students living in a permanent housing
       for the 2019-2020 school year. The average attendance <a href= "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/nyregion/new-york-city-homeless-school-attendance.html?">for students who were living in sheleter was 83%
       as compared to those living in permanent housing, which was 92%.</a> Overall, the numbers of homeless students from pre-k to 12th grade
        were particularly high in The Bronx. </p>

    <p> Farah Despeignes, a certified teacher, and the current president of District 8 Education is not surprised that
    The Bronx has the highest numbers of homeless students. " The Bronx is like a forgotten borough," Despeignes said.
  The city, state and federal needs to be make The Bronx a priority. </p>
